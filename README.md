# Hearthstone
# Years ago I used to play Hearthstone computer card game from Blizzard.
# Each half of the year a Global Championships were organized where 16 best players fight for title.
# Before each championship starts all players have been allowed to 'vote for your champion', 
# a bet where you can win card packages each time your champion wins a match or later advance to the next round.
# This project has been written around the year 2018 to help me in voting.
# Using metadata of deckA vs deckB winratios I tried to estimate who can advance to the final and take the title - and become 'my hero'.

# The files in this project contain:
# - single match simuation
# - N simulations of the whole tournament where each game is played once (so suprises are possible)
# (non added yet) - 1 simulation of the whole tournament where each game is played multiple times (which reduces the probability of suprising results)
